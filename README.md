# Aurora Backoffice
This repository contains the management interface of the Aurora software suite.
The backoffice is primarily responsible for sending commands to the [core](https://github.com/gewis/narrowcasting-core) over HTTP.
To see the current state of Aurora, the backoffice can also receive SocketIO messages.

## Prerequisites
- NodeJS 20.
- A locally running copy of [aurora-core](https://github.com/gewis/narrowcasting-core).
The backoffice repository should be cloned next to the core repository, so in the folder `../aurora-core`.
This is necessary to generate the required API client files (installation step 2).

## Installation
1. Run `npm install`.
2. Run `npm run gen-client` to generate the Typescript files required to communicate with the core.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. The application should now be running at http://localhost:8080.
In a development environment with a local copy of Aurora Core, you should be logged in automatically.

## Deployment
Deployment is done using Docker-compose in the core repository.
This should work out of the box if you meet the prerequisites.
