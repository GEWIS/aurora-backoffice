# Aurora Backoffice
This repository contains the management interface of the Aurora software suite.
The backoffice is primarily responsible for sending commands to the [core](https://github.com/gewis/aurora-core) over HTTP.
To see the current state of Aurora, the backoffice can also receive SocketIO messages.

## Prerequisites
- NodeJS 22.
- A locally running copy of [aurora-core](https://github.com/gewis/aurora-core).
The backoffice repository should be cloned next to the core repository, like the following:
```
parent-dir/
├── aurora-core/
└── aurora-backoffice/
```
This is necessary to generate the required API client files (installation step 2).

## Installation
1. Run `yarn`.
2. Run `yarn gen-client` to generate the Typescript files required to communicate with the core.
3. Run `yarn dev`.
4. The application is now running at http://localhost:8080.
In a development environment with a local copy of Aurora Core, you should be logged in automatically.

## Deployment
Deployment is done using Docker-compose in the core repository.
This should work out of the box if you meet the prerequisites.
